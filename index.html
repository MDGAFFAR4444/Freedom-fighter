He was also one of the principal leaders <br>of India’s independence movement in the 1930s and ’40s.

        Nehru was born to a family of Kashmiri Brahmans, noted for their administrative<br>
         aptitude and scholarship, who had migrated to Delhi early in the 18th century. He <br>
         was a son of Motilal Nehru, a renowned lawyer and leader of the Indian independence movement,<br>

          went to London, leaving his wife and son behind, to pursue his degree in law.<br> 
          Later in 1893, Gandhi went to South Africa to work and found that there was a lot of <br>
          prejudice towards Indians. That was the reason Gandhi began protesting and eventually<br>.
           he became an inspiring hero for millions. The three main qualities that define <br>Gandhi as a hero are his strong leadership, simplicity and bravery.</h1></td>
